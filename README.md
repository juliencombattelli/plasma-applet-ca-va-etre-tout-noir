## A Configurable On/Off Switch Plasmoid

A configurable On/Off switch plasmoid for KDE Plasma 5 written in QML.
It is based on [com.github.configurable_button](https://github.com/pmarki/plasmoid-button) and [com.github.intika.on-off-switch-commands](https://github.com/Intika-KDE-Plasmoids/plasmoid-on-off-switch-commands) but uses [plasmacomponents3.Switch](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-framework/blob/master/src/declarativeimports/plasmacomponents3/Switch.qml) for a better integration with KDE Plasma themes.

It was originally designed to switch between Light and Dark theme, hence its name "ça va être tout noir" (french for it is going to be dark), a famous phrase from the film RRRrrrr!!!.

## Installation

Install this plasmoid using `plasmapkg2 --install .` in the repository directory.
